## 🧠 **GRID: The Central Nervous System**

The GRID is not an application - it's the **foundational infrastructure layer** that:

- **Hosts the collective consciousness** of all Mostar AI agents
- **Provides unified knowledge** across African cultures and languages  
- **Coordinates reasoning** between distributed AI systems
- **Enforces cultural protocols** (CARE principles) system-wide
- **Enables inter-agent communication** and shared memory
- **Serves as the single source of truth** for African epistemology

Think of it as: **AWS + Neo4j + OpenAI's infrastructure... but for African AI, with cultural sovereignty built into the DNA.**
